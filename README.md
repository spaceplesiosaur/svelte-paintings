# Svelte Paintings (aka Ponies and Ballerinas)

Svelte paintings is a Svelte app the pulls from the [Harvard Art Museum API](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs).

This app specifically pulls the works of Edgar Degas, and sorts them by classification, which translates to type of work.

Click a button, and see all works by Degas of that classification.  Scroll sideways to mimic the experience of walking through a museum.
